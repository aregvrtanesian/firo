What is Firo?
--------------

[Firo](https://firo.org) formerly known as Zcoin, is a privacy focused cryptocurrency that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs which allows users to destroy coins and then redeem them later for brand new ones with no transaction history.

Our research created the [Lelantus privacy protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/373) which supports high anonymity sets without requiring trusted setup and relying only on standard cryptographic assumptions. The Lelantus cryptographic library was audited by [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/zcoin-lelantus-summary.pdf) and funded by Firo's CCS. Lelantus' cryptography was also audited by [ABDK Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting/).

Firo also utilises [Dandelion++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11060) to obscure the originating IP of transactions without relying on any external services such as Tor/i2P.

Firo developed and utilizes [Merkle Tree Proofs (MTP)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03588.pdf) as its Proof-of-Work algorithm which aims to be memory hard with fast verification to encourage mining using commodity hardware.

Running with Docker
===================

If you are already familiar with Docker, then running Firo with Docker might be the the easier method for you. To run Firo using this method, first install [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community). After this you may
continue with the following instructions.

Please note that we currently don't support the GUI when running with Docker. Therefore, you can only use RPC (via HTTP or the `firo-cli` utility) to interact with Firo via this method.

Pull our latest official Docker image:

```sh
docker pull firoorg/firod
```

Start Firo daemon:

```sh
docker run -d --name firod -v "${HOME}/.firo:/home/firod/.firo" firoorg/firod
```

View current block count (this might take a while since the daemon needs to find other nodes and download blocks first):

```sh
docker exec firod firo-cli getblockcount
```

View connected nodes:

```sh
docker exec firod firo-cli getpeerinfo
```

Stop daemon:

```sh
docker stop firod
```

Backup wallet:

```sh
docker cp firod:/home/firod/.firo/wallet.dat .
```

Start daemon again:

```sh
docker start firod
```

Linux Build Instructions and Notes
==================================

Dependencies
----------------------
1.  Update packages

        sudo apt-get update

2.  Install required packages

        sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev cmake

3.  Install Berkeley DB 4.8

        sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev

4.  Install QT 5

        sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev libzmq3-dev
        sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqrencode-dev

Alternatively, you can use a [depends build](depends/README.md) to handle dependencies.

Build
----------------------
1.  Clone the source:

        git clone https://github.com/firoorg/firo

2.  Build Firo-core:

    Configure and build the headless Firo binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).

    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.
        
        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make

    Note that the use of a [depends build](depends/README.md) necessitates passing the `--prefix` option to `./configure`.

3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests:

        ./configure --enable-tests
        make check
